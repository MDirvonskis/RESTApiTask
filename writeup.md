Express.js
```
- A feature of Express would be the middleware that allows modification of request and response objects. For example, using CORS (Cross-origin resource sharing) which modification of request and response objects.
- As Express.js is built on node.js, which means we have access function anywhere in the program. By having these functions commands like "app.get", we are able to reduce that amount of code we have to manually program.
- Another feature of express.js is has Routing and HTTP Methods. Express use REST (representational state transfer), which provides the use of GET, PUT, POST, DELETE methods. I implemented these methods to request and respond to the front end and back end server.
```

Vue.js
```
- The first feature of Vue.js framework is that you can bind html to the data model, creating a two way mapping when utilizing 'v-models'.
- Another feature would be that is seperated data from the layout with the use of states. This allows reloading of code withough the loss of data.
- Additionally, Vue.js contains directives like 'v-else', 'v-for', 'v-if' which interacts with DOM elements.
```
JavaScript
```
- Javascript has inline functions like '.then()' which executes asynchronously which enables paralysation. This improves processing speed as the functions don't execute one by one. 
- Javascript has dynamic typing, meaning that variables are defined based on the stored value.
- Another feature would be that it's a prototype-base scripting language. So instead of creating a class and then objects for them in c#. With javascript, any object can specify its own properties for a new object.
